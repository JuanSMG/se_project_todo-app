# Simple Todo App

This is my Sprint 7 Todo website project on which I was required to refractor and use OOP to oganize and create more maintainable code.

## Functionality

this website allows you to create a to-do list that can write a description and date for when and what to-do you needed done

## Technology

I used gitbash, internet exployer, Visual Studio and used gitpages to deploy online. Pictures, GIFs, or screenshots that detail the project features are recommended.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
